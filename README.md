# Basic-Gate-using-LT-Spice
NAND Gate is one of the universal gate. A universal gate is a digital logic gate that can be used to implement any Boolean function without requiring other gates. This repository explains the implementation of NAND Gate in CMOS Logic using LT Spice Simulator. This shows the schematic of NAND Gate and plot the output waveform to verify the functionality.
